# COMP1900
========

These are the programs that make up my homework and projects from my first semester in computer science.
Any pros looking over this: be gentle!

## LotteryProject
The second project of the semester. Hold a virtual lottery drawing. Uses arrays, linear search, loops, and random number generation.

## PartitionBenchmark
Lab 6 homework. Compare the speed of two array partitioning methods.
